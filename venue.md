## Why a hackathon at Borkum?

The goal of the hackathon is to get stuff done! This requires a quiet but still inspiring environment. We think an island reflects this very well.

Borkum is partially car-free. There is only one town, which is called like the island, Borkum.

## Getting to Borkum

Borkum is served by ferries from Emden, Germany and Eemshaven, the Netherlands.  The ferry from Emden takes 2 hours and 15 minutes and from Eemshaven 50 minutes. The harbour and the town of Borkum are connected via a little train.

Detailed information is available at [https://www.borkum.de/allgemein/service/anreise/](https://www.borkum.de/allgemein/service/anreise/).

## Accommodation and Costs

The hackathon base will be [Jugendherberge Borkum](https://borkum.jugendherberge.de/). We will have several breakout rooms for decent hacking and presentations.

We expect that participants stay there and share a room to ease logistics and keep costs low. We will try to subsidize accommodation costs as most as possible. Details will follow.
